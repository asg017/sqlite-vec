# `sqlite-vec` on Android and iOS devices

`sqlite-vec` can run on mobile devices like Android and iOS. As of `v0.1.2`, We publish pre-compiled loadable library for both platforms to [our Github Releases](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec/releases).

You can drop those files into your Android Studio or XCode projects as needed. We eventually will also include [`.aar` file support](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec/issues/102) and [`.xvframework`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec/issues/103) support in future releases.

If you have any feedback or ideas on how we can better support Android/iOS projects, please [file an issue](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec/issues/new).

Also consider [`op-sqlite`](https://github.com/OP-Engineering/op-sqlite) for React Native, which [has builtin support for `sqlite-vec`](https://ospfranco.notion.site/Installation-93044890aa3d4d14b6c525ba4ba8686f#:~:text=sqliteVec%20enables%20sqlite%2Dvec%2C%20an%20extension%20for%20RAG%20embeddings).
